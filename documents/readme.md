The document folder. My library.

## Classification rule:

1. rule 1
remember the MCMC rule.

2. rule 2: storage is for to reuse.

Eg:
I have some files all about the vector control, some of documents are from `SCDC`, some of them were from `WHO`, but it's all about vector control.

When at sometime, I would like to search about some documents about the vector control, I would start at this folder.

## Naming Rule:

**b** - **books**.
**o** - **official files**.
**r** - **reports**
**c** - **charts**
